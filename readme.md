# lumiere
Lumiere is a programming language in its infancy I am developing to gain a better insight into compiler infrastructure, and to familiarize myself with LLVM. It is not intended for real world use. Luimere adheres to the functional paradigm because I'm too lazy to implement classes.

### note for me
Select `shaderlab` as the language in vscode for lumiere files, it higlights decently
