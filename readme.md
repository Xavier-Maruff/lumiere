# lumiere
Lumiere is a programming language designed to make declarative server programming quick to develop, performant, and robust.
Currently it is none of those things, but coming along at a decent rate. Lumiere adheres to the functional paradigm, because I'm too lazy to implement classes.

### note for me
Select `shaderlab` as the language in vscode for lumiere files, it higlights decently
